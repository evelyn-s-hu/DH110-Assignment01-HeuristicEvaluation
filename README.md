# Evaluating the Washington State Departments of Ecology and Tourism
**State of Interest:** Washington State  
**Author:** Evelyn Hu  
**Course:** DH110 User Interface and Design  
**Description:** A heuristic evaluation of the websites of the Washington State Department of Ecology and Department of Tourism using Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics.

## Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation of Washington
The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate various government webpages to ensure that they are designed in a way that allows for a good user experience. As government websites are accessed by all kinds of people, it is crucial that good design choices were made so that they are accessible to everyone who views it. As someone who grew up in Seattle, Washington, once of the things I miss the most about Washington is its beautiful nature. The Pacific Northwest is famous for its breathtaking sceneries and hiking spots, and for good reason - the sights are truly one to behold. By inspecting the Departments of Ecology and Tourism, I would like to encourage more people to attain more information about these respective departments and one day experience the sights for themselves, through the act of improving upon the websites.  

## Severity Ratings of Usability Problems by [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
The following scale will be used to evaluate the various heuristics present on each website to determine whether or not an improvement is necessary.  
**1** = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  
**2** = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority  
**3** = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
